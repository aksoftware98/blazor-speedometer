## Blazor Speedometer 

Because I'm big fan of motorsport and I go kart every week, I decided to share my experience with everyone through my new YouTube channel [AK Racing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd8v6rsqC362S1kZ7HrOk4Q)

After I got my GoPro and started recording the videos, I decided to have my own effects on the videos to keep it unique. I had to extract the GPS data from each video and build my own speedometer, then I added that to my videos. 

> You can find the GPS data as JSON in the  wwwroot folder and the rest of the logic in the Index.razor component
